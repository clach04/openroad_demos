An ancient demon (Mr. Howdy) possesses an unsuspecting young girl living on a plush Georgetown estate. Two priests (Jason Miller and Max von Sydow) shake the demon free by sprinkling it with water and saying rude things to it, some of them in Latin. The young priest (Miller) is so rude to the demon that it kills him.

Orson Welles won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the Georgetown estate (Best Performance by an Actor as an Edifice or Landform). Trevor Howard gives a stirring performance as the Key Grip. Jim Nabors is smart and sassy as the Best Boy. Cut, cut, cut. Hold on. That's "The Exorcist." My mistake.
