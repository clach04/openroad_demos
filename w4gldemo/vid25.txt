Federico Fellini's surreal self-portrait of a filmmaker trying to make a movie while managing all the demanding women in his life (his wife is upset with him because he has a mistress, his mistress is mad at him because he is in love with Claudia Cardinale, etc.). A mixture of reality, dreams, and fantasy shows us that deep down inside, he is, of course, just a little boy.
