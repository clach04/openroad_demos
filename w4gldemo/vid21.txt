This stars that famous musical duo Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald. No, it isn't the one where he warbles "By a Waterfall, I'm calling you...ou...ou...ou," and its not the one where he wears a Canadian Mountie uniform. No, this is a politically incorrect love story, in which Marcia Mornay, the toast of all Europe, chooses her career over love and dies a lonely old woman haunted by regrets. Still, it could have been worse. Imagine being stuck with Nelson Eddy for 50 years.
