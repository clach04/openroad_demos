A tall, white door opens. Inside, there is a bright light, which, for a moment, blinds the viewer. A chill frosts the camera lens. As the frost clears, several interesting objects emerge. Bottles and jars in varying colors and forms and in varying states of capacity. A tall carton stands to the left, a chicken carcass lies to the right. Wait a minute. That's no movie, it's my refrigerator. Sorry. Dustin Hoffman plays the chicken carcass. Milk carton as itself.
