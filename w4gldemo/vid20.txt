Ellie (Colette Colbert) is a headstrong heiress who is running away from her fortune-hunting husband. Pete (Clark Gable) is the hard-boiled reporter that she meets on the Greyhound bus. There's a $10,000 reward if he brings her back to her father, but there are also the shapely legs that bring a car to a screeching halt in the famous hitch-hiking scene.
