In medieval Japan, an aristocratic couple travelling through the forest encounters a bandit. While a lowly woodcutter looks on, the husband is killed. But what really happened? Did the wife entice the bandit into killing her husband?  Or did the bandit rape the woman and kill her husband when he tried to defend her? This film tells that same story four times, from four different points of view. Even Miss Marple would have a hard time with this one.
