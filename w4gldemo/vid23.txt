The story of how five people's lives are affected when they cross briefly at the Grand Hotel. The story revolves around an aging ballerina (Greta Garbo), a dying factory clerk determined to have one last fling (Lionel Barrymore), a handsome nobleman desperately in need of money (John Barrymore), a textile magnate who faces ruin unless he can negotiate a merger (Wallace Beery), and a lovely young stenographer seeking the good life (Joan Crawford).  Garbo says, "I want to be alone," but does she really mean it?
