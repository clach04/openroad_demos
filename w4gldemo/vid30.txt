Francois Truffaut's semi-autobiographical story of a fatherless boy driven to deliquency by an indifferent adult world. It has something to do with the fact that his mother is making love with her boyfriend in the next room, but I'm not sure what. Actually, things get a lot better for Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's later films, like Stolen Kisses, in which he has an endless supply of gorgeous girlfriends and his biggest problem is trying to decide who to be faithful to.
