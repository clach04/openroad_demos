A sweeping indictment of racial prejudice and the damage it inflicts on both the victim and oppressor. Stephan Kumalo (Canada Lee) journies from the hills around Natal to Johannesburg in response to a letter from Reverend Msimangu (Sidney Poitier). He finds that his sister is a prostitute, his brother is an embittered activist, and his son is on trial for murdering a rich white man. The movie ends on a hopeful note as Kumalo and the white prosecutor build a friendship based on their mutual losses and hopes for a better future.
