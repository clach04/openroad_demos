Remember when every one in the movies used to threaten to run off and join the Foreign Legion?  Well, in this movie, the Geste brothers, Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, and Robert Preston, do just that. In a self-sacrificing attempt to save the family name, the three brothers endure the heat of the Sahara, the cruelty of the vicious Sergeant Markoff, and attacks by hordes of Arabs, all the while looking ravishingly handsome in their boots and epaulets. Is this what happens when you grow up playing soldiers, sailors, and knights in armor?
