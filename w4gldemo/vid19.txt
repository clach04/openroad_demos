This was Greta Garbo's first comedy! Ninotchka is a prim, proper, dedicated Communist, who is sent to Paris to sell "legally" confiscated jewels that belonged to the Grand Duchess Swana in order to raise money to buy tractors.  Will the beautiful comrade succumb to the capitalist delights of Paris, the truffles, the champagne, and the decadent fashions, not to mention the suave charms of Count Leon whose mission is to foil her? Or is love just a chemical reaction?
