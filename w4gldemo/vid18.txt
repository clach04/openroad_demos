A silly British fellow squares off against a silly Japanese fellow in a contest to prove who is the most stubborn. To prove he is the most stubborn, the Japanese fellow proposes to make the British fellow build a bridge. To prove he is the most stubborn, the British fellow does it. Meanwhile, a less silly American fellow joins a slightly silly Canadian fellow and a stupendously silly British fellow in a silly effort to destroy the bridge. In the end, the bridge is destroyed and most of the silly fellows kill one another; only the stupendously silly British fellow survives. Alec Guiness starts as the stubborn silly British fellow, William Holden as the less silly American fellow, and whatshisname as the stubborn silly Japanese fellow.
