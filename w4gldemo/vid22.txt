You've seen it. We've all seen it. See it again. Briefly, Humphrey Bogart is by turns selfish and selfless. Claude Rains is by turns greedy and lecherous. Ingrid Bergman (no relation to Ingmar, but I don't think there was any bad blood between them) is by turns ravishing and ravishing. Sydney Greenstreet doesn't do much turning, owing to his considerable girth. Peter Lorre gets it, but good (worth the price of admission).
