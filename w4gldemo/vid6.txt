I thought it was going to be another tear-jerker about produce, like, say, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," or "The Three Faces of Raddichio," but it wasn't that at all. Instead, it was a tear-jerker about a Depression-era family struggling to eke out a new existence under impossible conditions in central California. People die. Injustice reigns. Perfect light early-evening fare.
